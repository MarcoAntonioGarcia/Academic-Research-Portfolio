# Project 01: Finite Volume Method for Heat Transfer 1D

## Description

This project implements the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** to solve a one-dimensional transient heat transfer problem. The code allows analyzing the temperature distribution in a fin considering different materials and numerical schemes (explicit, implicit, and Crank-Nicolson).

## Overview
This project was completed in **May 2019** as part of the undergraduate program at the *Universidad de Guanajuato*, under the supervision of **Dr. César Eduardo Damián Ascencio**.

It represents one of the author’s **first academic experiences in scientific computing and numerical simulation**, using the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** to analyze one-dimensional heat transfer problems.  
Although developed early in the academic career, this work reflects the foundation of later interests in **computational physics**
