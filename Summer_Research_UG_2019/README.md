# Summer Research – UG 2019

**Project:** Thermodynamic Study of Quantum Decoherence in Logic Gates under the SEAQT Framework  
**Program:** Summer of Young Scientists, University of Guanajuato  
**Year:** 2019  
**Duration:** 100 hours  

## Description
This project was carried out during my participation in the **Summer of Young Scientists 2019** at the **University of Guanajuato**, within the **Division of Engineering**.  

It represents a continuation and deepening of the line of research initiated in 2018, focused on **quantum thermodynamics and information theory**. The study explores **the thermodynamic behavior and entropy generation in quantum logic gates**, specifically the **H–CNOT quantum circuit**, under the **Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Quantum Thermodynamics (SEAQT)** framework.  

This work served as the **core of my undergraduate thesis** and constitutes **early evidence of my independent research activity** in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. It demonstrates my initial ability to develop original theoretical models, analyze non-equilibrium processes, and interpret entropy-based quantum evolution.  

**Note:** This project is presented as a **historical record of my early research experience**, showcasing the foundations of my later academic and scientific development.
