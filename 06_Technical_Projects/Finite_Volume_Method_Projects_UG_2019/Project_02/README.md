# Project 02: Finite Volume Method for 2D Convection-Diffusion

## Description

This project implements the **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** to solve a **two-dimensional steady-state convection-diffusion problem**. It allows the analysis of the distribution of a scalar property $\varphi$ in a rectangular domain, using different numerical schemes:

- **UDS (Upwind Differencing Scheme)**  
- **CDS (Central Differencing Scheme)**  

The code provides control over **mesh density**, **boundary conditions**, and other numerical parameters, highlighting aspects of **numerical stability** and **scheme accuracy**.

## Overview

This project was originally developed in **August 2019** as part of the author's early engagement in **scientific computing and numerical simulation** at the *Universidad de Guanajuato*, under the supervision of **Dr. César Eduardo Damián Ascencio**.  

It represents an **extension of prior work in one-dimensional heat transfer**, exploring more complex two-dimensional problems. This project reflects the author’s **continued involvement in high-level computational research**, building a foundation for advanced studies in **computational physics and numerical methods for PDEs**.
